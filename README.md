# **Twisted-SMC-AR-Navigation**

## **Overview**

This repository implements an advanced **context-aware augmented reality (AR)** system that utilizes **Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)** methods for probabilistic inference in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The system is designed for real-time urban navigation, enabling users to ask questions about landmarks, venues, or other surroundings. By leveraging twisted SMC, the system provides highly adaptive and accurate interpretations of user queries in the context of AR.

**Key Features:**
- **Twisted SMC** for handling complex, high-dimensional probabilistic inference, improving query interpretation in ambiguous contexts.
- **Real-time AR integration** that combines spatial, visual, and contextual data for more relevant responses.
- **Natural Language Understanding** that uses probabilistic models to adapt to the user’s environment, behavior, and input context.
- **Modular Architecture** allowing for scalable integration of AR components and NLP models.

## **Project Architecture**

The project is divided into several key modules:

1. **NLP Module**: Uses twisted SMC to interpret user queries probabilistically, refining predictions based on visual and spatial context.
2. **Spatial Awareness Module**: Captures real-time spatial data such as GPS location and AR maps to localize the user and provide context-specific information.
3. **Visual Recognition Module**: Identifies objects, buildings, and landmarks in the user's view using computer vision techniques.
4. **User Interaction Module**: Gathers user input (text or voice) and displays real-time AR overlays with relevant information.

## **Installation Guide**

### **Prerequisites**

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** (Python package installer)

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Twisted-SMC-AR-Navigation.git
   cd Twisted-SMC-AR-Navigation
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   Install all required Python libraries by running the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up AR and Vision Components**:
   - Ensure you have **ARKit** (for iOS) or **ARCore** (for Android) SDK installed for handling AR.
   - The **OpenCV** library will be used for basic visual recognition tasks, so make sure it’s included in your environment.

## **Usage**

### **Running the AR Navigation System**

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the system by executing:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

The system will start listening for user queries (text or voice). It will capture real-time spatial and visual data from the AR environment, apply twisted SMC to probabilistically infer the user's intent, and display relevant AR overlays in response.

### **Example Interaction**

1. The user opens the AR system and scans a nearby landmark.
2. The system recognizes the landmark and waits for a user query (e.g., **"What's special about this place?"**).
3. Using twisted SMC, the system interprets the query in the context of the identified landmark and visual inputs, offering responses like **"This restaurant's daily special is grilled salmon"** or **"This building has historical significance."**

### **Running Unit Tests**

To verify the individual components, use the following command to run the test suite:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## **System Details**

### **Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)**

The core of this project is based on **Twisted SMC**, a variant of Sequential Monte Carlo designed to improve sampling efficiency in probabilistic inference. By twisting the proposal and transition distributions, this method helps explore the probability space more effectively, especially in the presence of ambiguity in natural language inputs.

1. **Initialization**: The system initializes a set of particles (interpretations) based on the user query.
2. **Twisting and Resampling**: The particles are twisted based on spatial and visual context, and resampled using the probability weights that represent the likelihood of each interpretation.
3. **Context-Aware Response**: The system narrows down to the most relevant interpretation and generates a response based on the twisted particle set.

#### **Example Process**

- **User Query**: "What's special here?"
- **Context**: The user is looking at a restaurant (recognized via object detection).
- **Twisted SMC**: Samples different potential meanings of "special" and updates particles based on the restaurant’s menu or historical context.
- **Final Response**: The system generates the most probable answer (e.g., daily special or historical fact).

## **Development Roadmap**

Here’s a high-level roadmap for the development of the system:

### **Phase 1: Initial Implementation**
- [x] Implement twisted SMC for query interpretation.
- [x] Set up AR environment to capture spatial and visual data.
- [x] Integrate basic object recognition for landmarks.

### **Phase 2: Enhancements**
- [ ] Improve NLP module by integrating advanced language models (e.g., GPT, BERT).
- [ ] Implement more sophisticated visual recognition using pretrained models (e.g., YOLO, Mask R-CNN).
- [ ] Enhance spatial reasoning by adding dynamic context (e.g., weather, traffic, events).

### **Phase 3: User Feedback and Learning**
- [ ] Add a learning module that tracks user behavior and improves predictions based on past interactions.
- [ ] Implement real-time feedback for continuous system improvement.

### **Phase 4: Deployment**
